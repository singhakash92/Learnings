1) anything start with cap's is an component and they return only one chile
2) anything start with 'use" is an hook

3)Use functional updates when the new state depends on the old state: If the new state depends on the current state (like in counters), itâ€™s a good practice to use a function form of the state updater to avoid issues with asynchronous updates. Example:
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
