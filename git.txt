1) git clone url
2) git remote add origin repourl  // if we have something in local we did git init and now want to move this data to repo point this folder to repourl 


making changes
2) git status // status of all the changes made in this file

3) git add [filename] or git add . // this add the particular file on stage inorder to commit it

4) git commit -m "message"  // this commits the changes which are staged




branch info
5) git checkout -b [branchname]  // it creates a new branch and moves to the new branch

6) git checkout [branchname]  // to switch between the branches

7) git branch // list of all the branches



some things to do before pushing
8) git pull // get latest changes from remote and merge to current branch

9) git merge [branchname]   // this will merger branchname branche with the current branch

10) git push 




start a new project
step1: git pull // take the latest changes
step2: git checkout -b featurename  // create a branch and work on that
step3: do changes and commit the stuffs
step4: switch to main branch and do git pull
step5: move back to feature branch 
step6: git merge mainbranch 
step7: git push
why we did that is because after doing changes we went back to see has anyone pushed something to main before me
if yes pull it 

and now move to our branch
and merge the changes
with this what happens is we can resolve the merge confict here in vscode
